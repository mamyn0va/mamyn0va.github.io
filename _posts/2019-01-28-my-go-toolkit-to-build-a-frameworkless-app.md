A few months ago, I started [my journey from PHP to Go]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-20-my-journey-from-php-to-go %}) on a new app in my company.

Some 3 months after, I posted another Article on DEV talking about [my feedbacks on the language]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-22-its-been-three-months-since-my-first-go-loc %}).

Now it's the time to share about the libraries & tools I've been using so far. Note that I don't use any framework nor any ORM. Just the right libraries to do the job.
